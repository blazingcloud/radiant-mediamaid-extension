== Getting Started
   
1. Install ImageMagick for your system. i.e. for Mac OS X":http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#macosx
Follow the various steps per O/S to fully install ImageMagick.  I found it helpful to edit the ".bashrc" file in my Mac O/S to add the environment variables:

MAGICK_HOME=[ImageMagick Installation Directory]/ImageMagick-6.5.8
PATH=[other path vars]:[ImageMagick installation directory]/bin
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=[your installation directory]/lib


2. If you don't already have it, you'll need the paperclip gem

gem install paperclip

3. If you don't have it installed, install Settings extension. In your Radiant root directory, enter:

git clone git://github.com/Squeegy/radiant-settings.git settings

4. Run the following to fully install Settings:

rake radiant:extensions:settings:migrate
rake radiant:extensions:settings:update

5. In your vendor/extensions directory, clone the code from github:

git clone git@github.com:blazingcloud/radiant-mediamaid-extension.git mediamaid

6. Run Radiant extension command-line functions:
rake radiant:extensions:mediamaid:migrate
rake radiant:extensions:mediamaid:update

7. Restart server
